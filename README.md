## Part1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### 1.1 Introduction of the Design 
This design work generates a series of randomly growing trees and leaves on the canvas by clicking the mouse. 

This is the initial state that the trees are generated once you click the mouse.

And this is the final display that the portrait will be seen when there are enough leaves.

### 1.2 Insights
I discovered some things worth learning from the above works:
- **Dynamic effect:** Randomness and dynamic changes are used to simulate the growth process of trees. This dynamic effect can attract the user's attention and increase the interest and charm of the artwork. **In my major project, I can also consider setting a scene theme.**
- **Portrait processing:** The two elements of leaves and portraits are connected. Pixel information is used to fill in the color of the leaves, thereby achieving a map effect of the leaves, creating a more vivid and textured effect. **In subsequent designs, I will consider adding connections between two different elements instead of separating them.**
- **Interaction design:** At the beginning, the effect of sowing seeds is simulated through mouse events (click). With such a setting, the interactive scene will be stronger. **When giving interactive events, I can have a more story-like feel, such as adding scenes or music.**
